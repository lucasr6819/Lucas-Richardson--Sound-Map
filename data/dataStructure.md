# Noise Pollution Map Data Structure

## Overview
This map visualizes noise pollution data across Vermont and Montreal regions. The data is organized using a structured JSON format that captures detailed information about noise levels, impacts, and mitigation efforts at various locations.

## Data Organization

        "overnight_activity": "Minimal",
        "frequency": "Constant",
        "restrictions": "None"
    },
    "seasonal_variations": {
        "summer": {
            "activity_level": "High",
            "details": "Increased outdoor activities",
            "decibel_range": "60-85 dB"
        }
    }
}
```

### Impact Assessment
```json
{
    "affected_area": {
        "total_acres": 500,
        "population_impacted": 5000,
        "housing_units_affected": 1200,
        "zone": "Residential/Commercial Mixed",
        "communities": ["Community A", "Community B"]
    },
    "health_impact": {
        "risk_level": "Moderate",
        "effects": [
            "Sleep disturbance",
            "Stress increase"
        ],
        "community_response": "Multiple complaints filed"
    }
}
```

### Mitigation and Studies
```json
{
    "mitigation_programs": {
        "active": true,
        "measures": ["Sound barriers", "Time restrictions"],
        "funding": "$500,000 annual budget",
        "oversight": "Environmental Department"
    },
    "study_metadata": {
        "study_type": "Long-term monitoring",
        "methodology": "24/7 automated measurement",
        "sampling_sites": "5 fixed locations",
